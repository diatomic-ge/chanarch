Chanarch is a program for downloading the files from 4chan threads.

See the file ChangeLog for a user-friendly list of changes, or run 'git log' in
a git clone of the chanarch repository for a more developer-friendly list of
changes.

See the file AUTHORS for a list of contributers.

Note that chanarch is beta-quality software at best, and is still under
development. Keep in mind some options and arguments are still subject to
change. Please report bugs or suggest features on chanarch's GitHub:

Features
--------

* Thread file downloading

* File download resuming

* Server connection reusage (greatly speeds multiple file downloads)

Usage
-----

Chanarch allows several methods of specifying threads to download.

In order to download a single 4chan thread, run:

  ./chanarch.py URL
  
URL should be something like:

  http(s)://boards.4chan.org/[BOARD]/thread/[THREAD_NUMBER]

Essentially, the URLs are just the same URL you would find a 4chan thread at in
a web browser.

This will download all of the files from this thread into a subdirectory of the
current directory, based on the thread number.

If you want to download multiple 4chan threads, run:

  ./chanarch.py URL URL ...

Each thread will be downloaded into its own subdirectory.

If you want to download to another directory, instead of the current directory,
run:

  ./chanarch.py -d DIRECTORY URL ...

This will create the subdirectories in DIRECTORY.

Chanarch can also read a list of threads from files. In order to do this, create
a file, or multiple files, with one URL per line. For instance:

  ./chanarch.py -f FILE

This will read URLs from FILE, one per line.

Multiple types of arguments can be used simultaneously, such as:

  ./chanarch.py -f FILE1 -f FILE2 -d DIRECTORY URL1 URL2

In order to get a full list of arguments, as well as their corresponding
long-argument versions, run:

  ./chanarch.py --help
 
For instance, it may be helpful to add the '-v' or '--verbose' flag to be
assured that threads are being downloaded.

In most shells, you can also run something similar to:

  while true; do ./chanarch.py -d DIR -f FILE; sleep 5m; done

This will repeatedly download threads, waiting for 5 minutes in between.
Essentially, this is an ad-hoc thread watcher.

Requirements
------------

Chanarch requires Python. It was written with both Python 2 and Python 3 in
mind, and should work equally on any recent version of Python, though Python
versions before 2.7 are not currently tested.

Downloading
-----------

Chanarch can be obtained from its GitHub page at:

  <https://github.com/diatomic-ge/chanarch>

or directly cloned with:

  git clone https://github.com/diatomic-ge/chanarch.git

The master branch will always point to the latest stable version, if one exists.
Other branches may contain more up-to-date, but unstable, versions.
